# Architecture Decision Records

## Active Decisions

*No ADRs yet. Create your first with `/adr <title>`*

## Deprecated Decisions

*None*

## How to use ADRs

1. Create new ADR: `/adr "Use PostgreSQL for primary database"`
2. Update ADR status: `/adr-update 001 accepted`
3. List ADRs: `/adr-list`

## ADR Template

Each ADR should follow this structure:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Draft/Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue?
- **Decision**: What are we doing?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?
- **Alternatives**: What else was considered?
