# CI Teacher Workflow - Claude as Your CI Mentor

This document explains how Claude acts as an intelligent CI teacher, analyzing failures, providing fixes, and teaching best practices.

## 🎯 Overview

The CI Teacher workflow transforms CI from a pass/fail gate into a learning opportunity:
- **Instant Analysis**: Claude analyzes failures in real-time
- **Auto-Fixes**: Automatically fix common issues
- **Educational**: Every fix includes learning context
- **Cost-Controlled**: Built-in budget limits
- **Progressive**: Adapts to team's skill level

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

When CI fails on a PR, you'll see:

```
❌ CI Failed

TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
at UserList.tsx:45

🤖 Need help?
Comment `@claude fix` to auto-fix these errors
```

Simply comment on the PR:
```
@claude fix
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze the error
2. Generate a fix
3. Apply it to your PR
4. Explain what happened

### Available Commands

```bash
# Fix errors
@claude fix                    # Fix all auto-fixable errors
@claude fix the TypeError      # Fix specific error
@claude fix tests             # Fix test failures only

# Get explanations
@claude explain               # Detailed error explanation
@claude explain the build error  # Specific explanation
@claude teach me about this   # Educational content

# Advanced
@claude suggest              # Get fix suggestions without applying
@claude review              # Review the changes
@claude prevent            # How to prevent this error
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Error Detection

The CI pipeline runs in fast-fail mode:

```yaml
Lint (5s) → Type Check (10s) → Build (30s) → Test (60s)
     ↓            ↓               ↓            ↓
   FAIL →    [Skip rest, analyze error, notify]
```

### 2. Intelligent Analysis

Claude categorizes errors:

```json
{
  "error_type": "TypeError",
  "category": "Null Safety",
  "severity": "high",
  "auto_fixable": true,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "education_level": "intermediate"
}
```

### 3. Auto-Fix Generation

For high-confidence fixes:

```diff
// Claude generates patch
- {users.map(user => (
+ {users?.map(user => (
    <UserCard {...user} />
  ))}
```

### 4. Educational Context

Every fix includes learning:

```markdown
## What Happened
The `users` array was undefined when the component rendered.

## Why It Happened
- Data loaded asynchronously
- No default value provided
- Component rendered before data arrived

## The Fix
Added optional chaining (`?.`) to safely handle undefined.

## Prevention
1. Always provide default values for arrays
2. Use loading states for async data
3. Add TypeScript strict null checks

### Learning Reports

Weekly learning reports are generated automatically:

```markdown
# CI Learning Report - Week 45

## Summary
- 23 CI runs, 87% success rate
- Claude fixed 18 issues automatically
- Team learned 5 new patterns

## Top Issues
1. **Null Safety** (8 occurrences)
   - Pattern: Missing optional chaining
   - Solution: Systematic null checks
   
2. **Async Testing** (5 occurrences)
   - Pattern: Missing await in tests
   - Solution: Async test utilities

## Lessons Learned
- Always handle loading states
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Test edge cases first

## Action Items
- [ ] Team training on null safety
- [ ] Update coding standards
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
```

## 🎓 Learning Modes

### Beginner Mode
Simple, clear explanations:
```
Error: Cannot find 'React'
Fix: Added import React from 'react'
Why: React must be imported to use JSX
```

### Intermediate Mode
More context and alternatives:
```
Error: Type 'string' not assignable to 'number'
Fix: ParseInt(value) or Number(value)
Trade-offs: parseInt vs Number vs unary +
Best Practice: Validate at boundaries
```

### Advanced Mode
Deep dives and architecture:
```
Error: Circular dependency detected
Analysis: Module graph shows A→B→C→A
Refactoring: Extract shared interface
Pattern: Dependency inversion principle
```

## 💰 Cost Control

### Budget Configuration

## 🔄 Complete Example

### PR with Failing CI

```yaml
PR #123: Add user dashboard
Status: CI Failed ❌

Errors:
1. TypeError at Dashboard.tsx:23
2. Test failure at dashboard.test.ts:45
3. ESLint: 3 warnings
```

### Developer Comments

```
@claude fix all
```

### Claude's Response

```markdown
## 🔧 CI Fix Applied

### Fixed Issues (3)
✅ **TypeError** - Added null safety check
✅ **Test Failure** - Updated expectation to match new behavior  
✅ **Lint Warnings** - Applied automatic formatting

### Changes Made
```diff
// Dashboard.tsx
- {metrics.map(m => <Metric {...m} />)}
+ {metrics?.map(m => <Metric {...m} />)}

// dashboard.test.ts
- expect(result).toBe('pending')
+ expect(result).toBe('active')
```

### Learning Points
